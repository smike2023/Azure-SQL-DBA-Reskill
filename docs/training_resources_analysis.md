## Executive Summary

This report curates the top hands-on training resources for Microsoft SQL Server Database Administrators (DBAs) across three leading platforms—Udemy, Coursera, and Pragmatic Works—with a focused comparison on practical coverage of SQL Server administration, AlwaysOn Availability Groups (AG) management, performance tuning, PowerShell automation, backup and disaster recovery (DR), security auditing, monitoring tools, and database DevOps. The intent is to help practicing and aspiring DBAs, IT trainers, and hiring managers build a sequenced, lab-driven learning plan that quickly translates into on-the-job capability.

The scope prioritizes courses that emphasize labs, realistic demos, and repeatable exercises over pure theory. Where available, we capture ratings, enrollments, duration, last-updated dates, and prerequisites. While coverage is strong across administration, PowerShell automation, performance tuning, and security, we found fewer courses that provide deep, stepwise DevOps CI/CD coverage within the specified platforms, which we flag as a gap to be filled by supplementary resources and vendor documentation.

The outcome is a ranked selection of 20 resources, a comparative analysis by skill area, and a set of role-based learning paths (junior DBA, mid-level DBA, DevOps/Automation, HA/DR specialist) designed to minimize time-to-competency. The final deliverable is intended to be saved as docs/training_resources_analysis.md.
